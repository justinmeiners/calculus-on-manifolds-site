<H1>MA570-Summer '99 Syllabus</H1>

<p>The catalog description is:
A self-contained course in n-dimensional analysis, including the
general form of Stokes' theorem.  Prereq: MA 432G or equivalent

<p>This will be a course in multivariate calculus and it certainly is aimed
toward a general form of Stokes' theorem.  It will not be self-contained --
it will assume that you have a good grounding in one dimensional calculus,
a basic knowledge of linear algebra, and a certain level of mathematical
maturity.  This will not be a spectator sport -- you will be spending the
bulk of your time working on problems.

<p>Here are some bookkeeping trivia:

<ul>
<li>Instructor:  Ken Kubota, 955 POT, 257-3641 (fax: 257-2975),
<a href="mailto:ken@ms.uky.edu">ken@ms.uky.edu</a>
<li>Textbook:  <i>Calculus on Manifolds</i> by Michael Spivak,
W. A. Benjamin, Inc, 1965.
<li>Grading:  Problems 80%,  Final Exam 20%
</ul>

<p><b>Instructor Accessibility:</b> Official office hours are 8-9 daily.
But if you want to talk, just catch me any time -- I can usually talk to
you within 10 minutes of when you find me.  Also, if you find that things
like problem sessions might be useful, just ask and we can schedule them.

<p><b>Problems:</b>  Except when you are specifically told not to do so, you may
work together on the solution of problems.  You may not work together on
the writing up of solutions, and you must attribute work -- if you collaborated
with someone on a particular problem, say so; if the crucial idea came from
someone, say so.  English exposition is important and it is expected that
at least a significant portion of the problems will be properly formatted
with a word processor, such as LaTeX.

<p>As the author says, "the problems are the most important part of the book,
and the reader should at least attempt them all."  In keeping with this,
until further notice, all problems in each section are assigned.
